## Overview

Ansible  is  a  radically  simple   IT  automation  platform  that  makes  your
applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code
to deploy and update your applications.  Automate in a language that approaches
plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
